    <h1>Welcome to City Of Naga Cebu!</h1>
    <p>Greetings, gentlemen and ladies. Allow me to present to you The Industrial Hub of Southern Cebu's well-known tourist attractions. Naga City exhibits its beauty to visitors in a way that is all its own.
    </p>
  
  <p>Naga is frequently reachable by bus from Cebu City's south bus station. Naga is located on the coastal route that runs south of the city. Along with KMK buses that travel from SM City Cebu via the Cebu South terminal, there are jeepneys from Cebu and neighboring towns. The area is now well-known for its picture-perfect peak, rolling hills, and stunning boardwalk, which draw thousands of tourists. The city will undoubtedly achieve greatness. The Province of Cebu's southern coast is where the City of Naga is situated.</p>

      <h2>Pasilong sa Naga</h2>
      <p>The renowned interior designer Kenneth Cobonpue invites you to view this incredible piece of art. The park created for the city of Naga, south of Cebu, is called Pasilong sa Naga, which translates as "to find shade in Naga." Interlocking rings that symbolize life's cycles and the natural world's cycle of taking from and returning to the earth make up the design. As they circle around the park, the varying-sized rings transform into elevated walkways, rest spots, benches, fountains, and twisting trails.
      </br> </br>
      <b><p>Now, how do we get there?</p></b>
      </br>
      Pasilong sa Naga is right in front of the Naga Plaza, across from the church along the road. However, some parts in the South are infamous for heavy traffic, so maybe you can go earlier in the afternoon to avoid rush hour.

For commuters, you can ride any jeepney that passes by Naga at the Archdiocesan Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes in Punta Princesa, but make sure to ask if they will pass by the city, since some will only stop by the town before it.

      <h2>Mt. Naupa</h2>
      <p>The tallest peak in Naga is Mt. Naupa, a mountain with an almost perfect cone. Just 587 meters or so are above sea level. Even though the mountain is only around a thousand meters above sea level, there are sometimes clouds all around it. Being one of Cebu's most accessible mountains, Mt. Naupa is also the most accessible location from which to see a sea of clouds. Despite being ranked as the eighth-highest peak in Central Visayas, Naupa is nevertheless highly recommended for climbing due to its simple and easy trail. It is so simple to climb that it is even advised for novices.
  </br>  </br> 
      <b><p>How to get there?</p></b>
      
   </br>
      
            <p>Take a jeepney from Colon Street on routes 09C/F or 10F/H, and get off at Pardo Church or Jollibee Bulacao (P8 cost). Proceed to Naga Plaza by using a different jeepney on route 44, which will cost P15. 44 jeepneys are also available from or close to CIT University in N. Bacalso. Take a bus from South Bus Terminal that is headed toward Carcar or Bato-Oslob. Inform the conductor that you intend to disembark at the Naga Church, situated directly beside the National Highway. </p>

      <h2>Boardwalk</h2>
      <p>The City of Naga is not like other rural vacation spots. Every year, this place hosts one of Cebu's largest celebrations, the Dagitab, or the Festival of Lights. It's a cross between a tranquil nature park and a serene waterfront promenade, providing you with a fresh bayside spot to enjoy your favorite pastimes.</p>
      
      <p>Often referred to as the Naga Baywalk, this expansive recreation area has gained recognition as the most well-liked public park in the City of Naga. In contrast to other nearby natural parks, Naga Boardwalk is tucked away from sidewalks and highways. The best thing is that there isn't an admission charge, making visiting this location one of the many inexpensive things to do in Cebu.</p>
  </br>  </br> 
    
       <b><p>How to get there?</p></b>
    
     </br>
       Ride a KMK Bus at SM City Cebu. This will bring you right to the City of Naga. However, you will have to compromise by waiting in line, since there are not that many KMK buses available in Cebu.

You can get off at the Naga Church, which is right across the city’s plaza. The City of Naga Boardwalk is a few meters behind the soccer field at the center of the plaza.

      <h2>Mt. Magdooc</h2>
      <p>Situated in Naga City, Cebu, Philippines, Mount Magdooc is a picturesque mountain top. Hikers and intrepid travelers will find it to be an excellent site with breathtaking views and spectacular overlooking points. Starting in Naga City at Rikio or Naalad, the hike up Mount Magdook begins. Despite its attractiveness, the trail is not well-known and is not frequently frequented by explorers from Cebu City.</p>
      </br>  </br> 

   <b><p>How to get to Magdooc? </p></b>
   
      As far as I know, there are a few ways to get to Mount Magdook. If you want to do it my way, first you need to take a multi-cab ride from Punta Princesa to Tungkop (Fare is PHP 13). From there, take a habal-habal ride to Pangilatan (Fare is PHP 50). Then, hike your way to Mount Magdook, and just ask the locals within the area for directions.

In my own estimation, there are also habal-habal rides that from Rikio that can take you to Mount Magdook. As for the fare, I’m not sure about it, but it will likely cost you around PHP 20 to 50 per person and per way.
